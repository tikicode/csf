Arijit worked on the C functions hash through is_space and the C main file.
Taran and Arijit created the rest of the C functions together. Arijit
wrote the is_space assembly function and Taran wrote the str_copy and 
str_compare functions. Arijit and Taran worked together to comment the 
assembly and C functions extensively.
