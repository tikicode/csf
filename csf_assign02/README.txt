MS1
Arijit worked on the C functions hash through is_space and the C main file.
Taran and Arijit created the rest of the C functions together. Arijit
wrote the is_space assembly function and Taran wrote the str_copy and 
str_compare functions. Arijit and Taran worked together to comment the 
assembly and C functions extensively.

MS2
Arijit worked on the isalpha, readnext, find_or_insert ad free_chain methods.
Taran worked on the tolower, trim_non_alpha, and dict_find_or_insert.
Taran and Arijit both worked extensively on testing and debugging
the methods, as well as on adding comments and increasing readability.
